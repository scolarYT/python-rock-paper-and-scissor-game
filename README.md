# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The user selects their choice, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The program then compares the two choices and determines the winner.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Save the provided code into a Python file, for example `test.py`.

3. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.

4. Run the script by typing:
   ```bash
   test.py
